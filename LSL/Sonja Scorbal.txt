[2009/06/20 23:46]  Sonja Scorbal: this music is nice
[2009/06/20 23:46]  Hiroshi Sakai: and musicians are only on for 30 min
[2009/06/20 23:46]  Hiroshi Sakai: so you get more variety
[2009/06/20 23:46]  Hiroshi Sakai: and if one sucks it doesn't last too long lol

[2009/06/20 23:48]  Hiroshi Sakai: lol
[2009/06/20 23:48]  Sonja Scorbal: the t shirt with the leather
[2009/06/20 23:48]  Sonja Scorbal: not anything you said
[2009/06/20 23:48]  Hiroshi Sakai: put it on tonight as a whim
[2009/06/20 23:48]  Hiroshi Sakai: lately i've usually worn a tie
[2009/06/20 23:49]  Hiroshi Sakai: where do you live in RL?
[2009/06/20 23:49]  Hiroshi Sakai: i live in Portalnd, Oregon
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: West coast also
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: kewl
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: CA prolly
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: smiles
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: Seattle
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: ooh much better ;o)
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: but dont fall in love with me and stalk me lol
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: more likely a woman of substance
[2009/06/20 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: but ok to fall in love iwth you OR stalk you?
[2009/06/20 23:51]  Sonja Scorbal: well I am trouble either way, because I am really commited to being single
[2009/06/20 23:51]  Sonja Scorbal: love it in fact
[2009/06/20 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: nothing wrong with that
[2009/06/20 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: not likely to stalk you or anyone else
[2009/06/20 23:52]  Hiroshi Sakai: i think being single is more natural than being married
[2009/06/20 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: I agreee
[2009/06/20 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: I like men and like sex and intimacy
[2009/06/20 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: but I also like my own bed
[2009/06/20 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: and my own space
[2009/06/20 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: mmm sounds perfect ;o)
[2009/06/20 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: matches my own thinking
[2009/06/20 23:53]  Sonja Scorbal: lol
[2009/06/20 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: so many pleasures a man and a woman can share together
[2009/06/20 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: but living together, lifelong committment -- so much extra baggage
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: i suppose if you're gonna have kids
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: that's a 20 year committment
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: but even then, not a lifetime
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Sonja Scorbal: agreed
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Sonja Scorbal: people get bored and lose their passion
[2009/06/20 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/20 23:55]  Sonja Scorbal: and they maybe still love and respect their partner but the passion is gone
[2009/06/20 23:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: actually I'm married in RL and am in exactly that situation
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Sonja Scorbal: hehe you and all the other men in sl
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: LOL
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Sonja Scorbal: none of them are getting any either
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: LOL
[2009/06/20 23:56]  Sonja Scorbal: or say they arent
[2009/06/20 23:58]  Sonja Scorbal: so
[2009/06/20 23:58]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah, sometimes I wonder how much of what people say in SL is true
[2009/06/20 23:58]  Sonja Scorbal: what do you do in SL besides find cute girls and take their picture?
[2009/06/20 23:58]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm a huge fan of the live music scene
[2009/06/20 23:58]  Hiroshi Sakai: i build and script some

[2009/06/20 23:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: lol -- it's even helped me learn geography
[2009/06/20 23:59]  Sonja Scorbal: are you Japanes in RL or do you just like Japanese names?
[2009/06/20 23:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: meet someone and wonder -- where the fuck is THAT??
[2009/06/20 23:59]  Sonja Scorbal: oh I keep a globe by my computer!
[2009/06/20 23:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: not japanese
[2009/06/20 23:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: i keep Google earth ;o)
[2009/06/21 0:00]  Hiroshi Sakai: i chose a japanese name because I have long admired their history and culture
[2009/06/21 0:00]  Sonja Scorbal: and the names just sound cool

[2009/06/21 0:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes i understand
[2009/06/21 0:06]  Sonja Scorbal: you want to dance?
[2009/06/21 0:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm visual also, though my RL work is all completely abstract
[2009/06/21 0:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/21 0:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: but first let me show you something
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: are you familiar with the sculptures of AM Radio?
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Sonja Scorbal: omg a band saw
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: he made that
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: incredibly realistic, no?
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Sonja Scorbal: yes I have been to his sims
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: ah
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Sonja Scorbal: he is amazing
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes he is
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: well i collected quite a number of his picese recently
[2009/06/21 0:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: but can't rez them all here -- too many prims
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Sonja Scorbal: the problem is
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Sonja Scorbal: yes I was about to say prims
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: so i've been working on some scripts to rez them one at a time
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: so click on his lab table here
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: right now i have 4 things in there
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Sonja Scorbal: coool
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: eventually i'll have all his collection for display
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Sonja Scorbal: wow
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Sonja Scorbal: that is very cool
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: this sewing machine is my latest acquisition
[2009/06/21 0:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: ty
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Sonja Scorbal: does the script you use make your land laggy?
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: and the band saw is someting he wasn't giving to everyone for free
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: not really
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: this is a private sim
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: i own 8K or 1/8 of it
[2009/06/21 0:09]  Sonja Scorbal: I had not seen his sewing machine
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: 90% of the time I'm here there's nobody else, so i seldom see lag
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: it's new
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: new to me
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Sonja Scorbal: are you friends with him?
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: when i was in college, my roommate had a sewing machine just like this
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: like exactly the same
[2009/06/21 0:10]  Sonja Scorbal: my grandma had one similar
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: she didn't use it though
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah it think it was his grandmother's
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: electric motors were a great invention
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: she used a new one
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: yea
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: there is a lot to be said for them
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: smiles
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: is it hard to load objects into the script
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: tedious, but not hard
[2009/06/21 0:11]  Sonja Scorbal: to make them res?
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: harder to get the script right
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Sonja Scorbal: do you have to script each prim?
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: no
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Sonja Scorbal: or just the root prim?
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: one script in the table to cycle between items
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: and a tiny script in each object
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Sonja Scorbal: ok
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: who's only role is to delete the object when done
[2009/06/21 0:12]  Sonja Scorbal: ah
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Sonja Scorbal: and then you tell the table script to  res on touch
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Sonja Scorbal: and which order
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Sonja Scorbal: and the name
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Sonja Scorbal: I hate scritping
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Hiroshi Sakai: order happens to be alphabetical
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Sonja Scorbal: but have learned some things
[2009/06/21 0:13]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm impressed
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Sonja Scorbal: I am not into all that ?><><//if? then when?>{}{}()(
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: LOL
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: hahahaha
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: no of course not
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Sonja Scorbal: makes me want to shoot myself
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: cryptic, arcane
[2009/06/21 0:14]  Sonja Scorbal: and I really dont get how a bunch of numbers can make things happen in my computer like this
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Sonja Scorbal: and it pisses me off a little that I don't get it
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Sonja Scorbal: lol
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: like I said -- i work in a completely abstract world
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: sometimes it's like poetry
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: but in a language nobdy understands
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Sonja Scorbal: but I can slow down the water I use to terraform it
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Sonja Scorbal: terraform
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: there you go ;o)
[2009/06/21 0:15]  Sonja Scorbal: and some other minor script adjustments
[2009/06/21 0:16]  Sonja Scorbal: only because I seem to attract scriptors
[2009/06/21 0:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: i have some art on display here ;o)
[2009/06/21 0:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: hmmm a beautiful woman like you i'd expect would attract non-scripters alike
[2009/06/21 0:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: the little one down low is some of AM Radio's images
[2009/06/21 0:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: you can click to change the image
[2009/06/21 0:17]  Sonja Scorbal: the last supper? with women in skimpy outfits
[2009/06/21 0:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes, "The Other Last Supper"
[2009/06/21 0:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: this is by a friend of mine, Callipygian Christensen

[2009/06/21 0:20]  Hiroshi Sakai: she also did the flowers on the left
[2009/06/21 0:20]  Hiroshi Sakai: there it's more of an impressionistic style
[2009/06/21 0:21]  Sonja Scorbal: I like it
[2009/06/21 0:21]  Sonja Scorbal: I paint in the style of the flowers
[2009/06/21 0:21]  Hiroshi Sakai: this is the original 'Le Origin du Mond"

[2009/06/21 22:51]  Sonja Scorbal: doors generally piss me off
[2009/06/21 22:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: it's kind of a bitch to set up
[2009/06/21 22:51]  Sonja Scorbal: but these are amazing
[2009/06/21 22:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: so most of the time it's open to the tropical sea ;o)
[2009/06/21 22:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: i spent a lotta time on them

[2009/06/21 23:06]  Sonja Scorbal: I like the design of your house
[2009/06/21 23:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: this image i think was the inspiration for the emperor's costume in Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado
[2009/06/21 23:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: ty
[2009/06/21 23:06]  Hiroshi Sakai: it started out a free Linden version of Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water
[2009/06/21 23:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: they got the textures right
[2009/06/21 23:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: but the building was wacko
[2009/06/21 23:07]  Sonja Scorbal: your bosai tree is very primmy
[2009/06/21 23:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: i used the textures, opened it way up

[2009/06/21 23:07]  Hiroshi Sakai: ah this is my favorite "people" image
[2009/06/21 23:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: an "action" shot
[2009/06/21 23:08]  Sonja Scorbal: the  movement
[2009/06/21 23:08]  Sonja Scorbal: yes

[2009/06/21 23:08]  Sonja Scorbal: and the colors are great
[2009/06/21 23:08]  Hiroshi Sakai: evidently this was a common technique way back then to denote action
[2009/06/21 23:08]  Sonja Scorbal: you are kinda of a smarty pants about art
[2009/06/21 23:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm reminded of how similar visuals are used in modern movies -- like the Matrix -- to denote high-speed action
[2009/06/21 23:09]  Hiroshi Sakai: omg you think so??
[2009/06/21 23:09]  Sonja Scorbal: yea

[2009/06/21 23:10]  Hiroshi Sakai: step 1, step 2, etc. ;o)
[2009/06/21 23:10]  Sonja Scorbal: with middle school you have to teach them everything
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: many have never painted a thing in their life
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: I was shocked when I got the job
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: if you dont teach them how to dip the brush
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm sure all teachers are shocked at first
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: they scoop it like ice cream
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: by the relative ignorance of their students
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: and it runs down their arm
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Hiroshi Sakai: LOL
[2009/06/21 23:11]  Sonja Scorbal: its true
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: I actually teach a lot of things step by step
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: at first
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: then let them get creative
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: ah
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: when they learn it
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Hiroshi Sakai: i believe it -- step by step seems the only way to "teach" anything
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: but they don't know anything
[2009/06/21 23:12]  Sonja Scorbal: some can draw pretty well
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Hiroshi Sakai: but art -- so deeply connected with creativity -- seems impossible to "teach"
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Sonja Scorbal: you can teach the elements of art and the principles of design
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Sonja Scorbal: line, shape, color contrast, repetition, texture
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Sonja Scorbal: teach them to talk about it and see it
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Hiroshi Sakai: how to dip a brush without getting it on your arm ;o)
[2009/06/21 23:13]  Sonja Scorbal: yea
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: smiles
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Sonja Scorbal: but also the thinking skills
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Sonja Scorbal: there is actually a lot to teach
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm sure
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Sonja Scorbal: people think it is an easy job
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: you called me a "smarty pants"
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Hiroshi Sakai: but I actually regard myself fairly ignorant about art
[2009/06/21 23:14]  Sonja Scorbal: like I just show up and slap down some clay
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Sonja Scorbal: well you know a lot of details about this period and style of art
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Sonja Scorbal: ok is this the whole house?
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: there's a 1st floor
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: i never use it
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: had a shower down there once
[2009/06/21 23:15]  Hiroshi Sakai: but if you cam down -- there's nothing
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Sonja Scorbal: I bet you had a bed down there once too
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: nope
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: never
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Sonja Scorbal: near the erotic print?
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: no
[2009/06/21 23:16]  Hiroshi Sakai: just keep it down there because i don't think it's appropriate for "public" consumption
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: there are some interesting images, however
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Sonja Scorbal: hehe scrolling throught the erotic ones
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: ooh this is a favorite
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Hiroshi Sakai: "the fishmonger's wife's dream"
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Sonja Scorbal: the squid?
[2009/06/21 23:17]  Sonja Scorbal: wow

[2009/06/21 23:29]  Hiroshi Sakai: not really
[2009/06/21 23:29]  Hiroshi Sakai: i wrote some scripts to play tunes from my MP3 library here in SL
[2009/06/21 23:30]  Sonja Scorbal: really!

[2009/06/21 23:31]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes, several
[2009/06/21 23:31]  Sonja Scorbal: oh!
[2009/06/21 23:31]  Hiroshi Sakai: had my own business for about 10 years
[2009/06/21 23:31]  Sonja Scorbal: do you know about the other sl where you can have as much land as you want for free
[2009/06/21 23:31]  Hiroshi Sakai: but went out of biz after 9/11

[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes, heard of it
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: i think it's the future
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: but not ready for prime time yet
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: lotta stuff doesnt' work
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Sonja Scorbal: yea and lonely there I heard
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Sonja Scorbal: and if you store your lands on your own computer
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes!
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Hiroshi Sakai: no more rent!
[2009/06/21 23:32]  Sonja Scorbal: then does that mean it takes up lots of space
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Hiroshi Sakai: dunno -- but i doubt it
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Hiroshi Sakai: define "lots"
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Sonja Scorbal: and the power
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Hiroshi Sakai: you can buy a trillion bytes of storage for under $100
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm in the biz and I still find that incredible
[2009/06/21 23:33]  Sonja Scorbal: well if I keep my lands on my computer will that take away storage for pictures and music?
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes it will
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Sonja Scorbal: and if my computer is off
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Hiroshi Sakai: but for $100 (one-time) you can buy lots more space
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Sonja Scorbal: my lands poof?
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Hiroshi Sakai: but why would you care if you're not online? ;o)
[2009/06/21 23:34]  Sonja Scorbal: other people might be there

[2009/06/21 23:37]  Hiroshi Sakai: smart women
[2009/06/21 23:38]  Hiroshi Sakai: they're trouble sometimes but they're the only ones worth bothering with
[2009/06/21 23:38]  Sonja Scorbal: well I can muster up strong but maybe smart, well I dont have a brain full of facts like some people
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: facts are just one dimension of smart
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Sonja Scorbal: but I can do a lot of things most "smart" people can't
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: smart is multi-fasceted
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Sonja Scorbal: agreed
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: you seem to have a practical smart
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: intuition is an important aspect of "smart"
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Sonja Scorbal: my smarts are about processes, and design and people, and functional stuff
[2009/06/21 23:39]  Sonja Scorbal: like how to change a tire
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Hiroshi Sakai: smiles
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Hiroshi Sakai wipes the grease from your cheek
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Sonja Scorbal: smiles
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes practical -- i value that highly
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Hiroshi Sakai: in part i suppose because I'm not so practical
[2009/06/21 23:40]  Sonja Scorbal: well I am a practical girl, but not so romantic
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Sonja Scorbal: in fact I need work on sensitivity
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm more theoretical, romantic
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Hiroshi Sakai: abstract
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Sonja Scorbal: lol we are a good fit then
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Hiroshi Sakai: not so grounded in reality
[2009/06/21 23:41]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes

[2009/06/21 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: had a guy dig a trench around it
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: filled with concrete
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: so the bamboo is esentially in a huge pot
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: nice
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: the year after I did that -- it shot up an extra 50%
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Hiroshi Sakai: from like 20' to over 3o
[2009/06/21 23:50]  Sonja Scorbal: thirty 30 high?
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Sonja Scorbal: dang
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: there abouts
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Sonja Scorbal: you restricted it's root growth
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Sonja Scorbal: so it had to go up
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: exactly!
[2009/06/21 23:51]  Hiroshi Sakai: and it's really pissed now ;o)
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: do you think it will jump your wall?
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Hiroshi Sakai: actually it did once
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Hiroshi Sakai: i had to raise it another 6"
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Hiroshi Sakai: i swear the plant is inteligent
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: how deep is your hole?
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Sonja Scorbal: for the wall
[2009/06/21 23:52]  Hiroshi Sakai: well i had the guy dig it 2' deep
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: and later added another 6" on top
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Sonja Scorbal: that should do it
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Sonja Scorbal: that is a lot of digging
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: the roots travel horizontally
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah paid someone to do it
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Sonja Scorbal: yea close to the surface
[2009/06/21 23:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: i understand it's similar to an ancient traditional method for containing bamboo
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: digging the trench
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: only the traditiona method involves going into the trench every year and trimming the roots
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: filling it with leaves meantime
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: too much maintainence
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Sonja Scorbal: yea
[2009/06/21 23:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: dug it once and filled with concrete
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: thought i was done -- except when it crawled over the top ;o)
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Sonja Scorbal: lol
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Sonja Scorbal: you gotta watch it
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: the extra 1/2' seems to have held it
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah, unruly little bastards
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Sonja Scorbal: rofl
[2009/06/21 23:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: could you excuse me for a mintue or two?
