[2009/05/27 20:35]  Hiroshi Sakai: how it would
[2009/05/27 20:35]  Twiggy Fizzle: Twiggy and Suz make Noma's concerts and both have seen you there.
[2009/05/27 20:36]  Twiggy Fizzle: I thought for the longest time that you and Noma were a couple
[2009/05/27 20:36]  Hiroshi Sakai: well i remember Suz but Twiggy somehow escaped my notice
[2009/05/27 20:36]  Hiroshi Sakai: LOL
[2009/05/27 20:36]  Hiroshi Sakai: she'll get a laugh out of that ;o)
[2009/05/27 20:37]  Twiggy Fizzle: Twiggy is very much on the fringes, usually quiet and that's just another side of me
[2009/05/27 20:37]  Twiggy Fizzle: awww..I know you are Noma are good friends
[2009/05/27 20:37]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah -- seemed everybody knew Suzy

[2009/05/27 20:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: and such a huge heart
[2009/05/27 20:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: so bold on the stage
[2009/05/27 20:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: but really a very shy person
[2009/05/27 20:39]  Hiroshi Sakai: and rather fragile
[2009/05/27 20:39]  Twiggy Fizzle: I think so too, but I don't know her as well as you...I'm just a fan
[2009/05/27 20:40]  Twiggy Fizzle: I've sensed she is shy too, but she's such a professional , started so young, she's knows how to entertain and be comfortable in front of a crowd
[2009/05/27 20:41]  Twiggy Fizzle: She's confident enough in what she does
[2009/05/27 20:41]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes, exactally -- total pro

[2009/05/27 20:43]  Hiroshi Sakai: but she's not interested
[2009/05/27 20:43]  Twiggy Fizzle: But I bet it's a LONG line
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Hiroshi Sakai: long line?
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Twiggy Fizzle: Long line of men wanting Noma
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Hiroshi Sakai: oh i'm sure
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Twiggy Fizzle: :)
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Hiroshi Sakai: last I heard she has a steady BF in SL
[2009/05/27 20:44]  Hiroshi Sakai: they may have broken up -- dunno
[2009/05/27 20:45]  Twiggy Fizzle: I saw her at a concert ..don't remember where, few weeks ago, and she was steadily dancing w/ a fellow
[2009/05/27 20:45]  Twiggy Fizzle: And they did not engage in open chat, so I took as ....
[2009/05/27 20:46]  Twiggy Fizzle: well you know
[2009/05/27 20:46]  Hiroshi Sakai: sex in public?? =8*O

[2009/05/27 20:47]  Twiggy Fizzle: NO...not necessarily, but that maybe that was her squeeze cuz I had never seen her dance quietly w/ anyone
[2009/05/27 20:47]  Hiroshi Sakai: well she was dating him for a long time
[2009/05/27 20:47]  Hiroshi Sakai: then they sort of broke up
[2009/05/27 20:47]  Hiroshi Sakai: then they got together again
[2009/05/27 20:48]  Hiroshi Sakai: i'm only speculating that maybe they broke up again

[2009/05/27 20:49]  Hiroshi Sakai: who happens to do a cover of this song ;o)
[2009/05/27 20:49]  Twiggy Fizzle: Well I don't see that often, out and about, so I really wouldn't know

[2009/05/27 20:53]  Twiggy Fizzle: cuz that's the name I gave him
[2009/05/27 20:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: ah
[2009/05/27 20:53]  Hiroshi Sakai: thought maybe because he "examined every part of you"
[2009/05/27 20:54]  Twiggy Fizzle: ROFL
[2009/05/27 20:54]  Hiroshi Sakai: smiles

[2009/05/27 20:55]  Twiggy Fizzle: Yes!
[2009/05/27 20:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: i knew about it but not about his individual GF

[2009/05/27 21:55]  Twiggy Fizzle: rofl
[2009/05/27 21:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: i have a cook book called "a man, a can, a plan"
[2009/05/27 21:55]  Twiggy Fizzle: oh too funny
[2009/05/27 21:55]  Hiroshi Sakai: all recipes you can cook by just opening cans, mixing the ingredients and heating them ;o)
[2009/05/27 21:55]  Twiggy Fizzle: and have you EVER cooked a thing out of that book?
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Twiggy Fizzle: or cans?
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: lol
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: maybe once, but I forget
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: yes, use canned goods sometimes
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Hiroshi Sakai: beans and tomatoes mostly
[2009/05/27 21:56]  Twiggy Fizzle nods and rolls her eyes...thinks he's is such a true man!
[2009/05/27 21:57]  Hiroshi Sakai: well i am also a pretty great cook
[2009/05/27 21:57]  Twiggy Fizzle: Aha...fluffy
[2009/05/27 21:58]  Twiggy Fizzle: Good..all men should be good cooks, or at least think they are.  And they must all master the grill...this will raise your rank in the real world of men's backyard bravado
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: oh i cook with fire whenever I can -- unless the weather is really cold and rainy
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: but some things work better in an electric oven
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Twiggy Fizzle: Now I am thinking of ribs
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Twiggy Fizzle: steak
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: ribs are a good example
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Twiggy Fizzle: just a hotdog would do for now
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: and pork shoulder
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Twiggy Fizzle: omg
[2009/05/27 21:59]  Hiroshi Sakai: need long, slow, low cooking
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Twiggy Fizzle: handle it hunny
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Hiroshi Sakai: pork shoulder I cook overnight at about 200 degrees
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Hiroshi Sakai: so tender, and flavorful
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Twiggy Fizzle: omg...I love pork
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Twiggy Fizzle: yes
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Hiroshi Sakai: my favorite meat
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Twiggy Fizzle: oh yum
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Hiroshi Sakai: ribs are great too -- but u gotta cook 'em slow and low
[2009/05/27 22:00]  Twiggy Fizzle: Actually, I like pork better than beef, but chicken is up there with pork for me
[2009/05/27 22:01]  Hiroshi Sakai: yeah, I'd agree
[2009/05/27 22:01]  Twiggy Fizzle: I have to do them in the slow cooker
[2009/05/27 22:01]  Hiroshi Sakai: not much experience with them
[2009/05/27 22:02]  Hiroshi Sakai: usually just put a pot in the oven on low
[2009/05/27 22:02]  Twiggy Fizzle: not enough, not on the grill, so I boil them just a bit and shove in the crockpot and cook em slow
[2009/05/27 22:02]  Hiroshi Sakai: sounds good
[2009/05/27 22:03]  Hiroshi Sakai: don't like them unless they're falling off the bone
[2009/05/27 22:03]  Twiggy Fizzle: Can't mess em up
[2009/05/27 22:03]  Twiggy Fizzle: Right..me too .  And the slower cooker does exactly that
[2009/05/27 22:03]  Twiggy Fizzle: The bones just fall away
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Hiroshi Sakai: i got one for xmas once, years and years ago but never used it much
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Hiroshi Sakai: well show's over
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Hiroshi Sakai: don't see any other live music I wanna see
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Hiroshi Sakai: you?
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Twiggy Fizzle: Yeah...and I need to get onto bed..it's late for me now
[2009/05/27 22:04]  Hiroshi Sakai: oh too bad
