Hello. My name is Wade.
I believe we may have met before.
Would you like to meet my sister? 

`v2
 Hello.  My name is Flo.
Later you'll meet some more of our family,  but first, let me tell you about our jobs.
Humans feed us text, and we pronounce it with our synthetic voices.
We produce our voices with a set of rules.
Our human teachers keep improving our rules, so our speech gets better and better.

`v1
All of the sentences we've said so far were given to us as ordinary text.
We figured out the intonation patterns ourselves.  But users can change how we sound,
with simple annotations.  
For example, users can tell us to emphasize a specific word in a sentence. 
Suppose another machine claimed to be the best talking computer.

I could then respond,`p300 no, `p250 `3 I'm the best
talking computer.
Or if someone told me I was the best talking monster,
I could say `%%, `p250 no, `p250 I'm the best
talking `3 computer.  
`2 Other simple marks help me to express my `2 emotions.  
For example, if I were tired I could `0 say,
`vs42 `vf36 `vb45  I'm feeling really slow `0 today.
`v1 Or if I were on a rocketship I could `0 say,
`p250 `vf37 `vb95 This is really exciting.  

`v2
`1 We're not the only `0 ones who are so `0 clever.
The rest of our `0 family is `2 just as `0
expressive as `2 we are.   Let us introduce you to some of
the `2 other members of our family.  

`v1
Our baby brother's `0 name is Bobbie.  He's still very little,
but he already talks `0 really well.  

`v3
Where's my mommy?  `vf31 `vb98 I lost my teddy `0 bear.  

`v1
And our grandmother is here too.  Hi `0 grandma `%.  

`v7
Well `2 hello Wade `%.  You're such a good grandson,
and you're `1 so eloquent.  
Your father would've been `1 very proud of you.  

`v1
`2 Thanks grandma `%.
There are `2 other members of our family `2 too.

You can easily change any of us to customize our voices for `2 your needs.
`vh100 `vb55 For example, you can make me bigger so I'll sound like a giant.
`v3 `vr60 Or you can `0 make Bobbie `0 sound like he has a `0
sore throat.
`v8 `vs85 This is Grandpa talking really fast.
`v2 `vy100 And this is Flo whispering so she can tell you a secret.
`v1 `vb100 `vv90 This is Wade pretending to be a woman.
`v3 `vb85 `vf6 And this is Bobbie when he's really bored.

`v1
The possibilities are endless, but you've probably `0 heard enough
for `0 now.  
Goodbye, and thanks for listening `/.
