## signals -- organize signals into a hierarchy
# 
# 

group = collection of sub-groups or individual signals
	+ on-rise action
	+ on-fall action

groups and sub-groups may overlap

result is an efficient reverse lookup:
	raw signal name or bitmap, rise or fall
		-> individual signal(s) names, actions
